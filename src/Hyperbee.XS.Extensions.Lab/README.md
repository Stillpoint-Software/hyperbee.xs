# XS.Extensions (Lab): Sample Extensions for Hyperbee.XS

### **What is XS?**

[XS](https://github.com/Stillpoint-Software/hyperbee.xs) is a lightweight scripting language designed to simplify and enhance the use of C# expression trees.
It provides a familiar C#-like syntax while offering advanced extensibility, making it a compelling choice for developers
building domain-specific languages (DSLs), rules engines, or dynamic runtime logic systems.

XS.Extensions (Lab) is a collection of sample and proposed extensions for the XS language, including:

- Fetch
- Json
- JsonPath
- Reduce
- Map
