# XS.Extensions: Extensions for Hyperbee.XS

### **What is XS?**

[XS](https://github.com/Stillpoint-Software/hyperbee.xs) is a lightweight scripting language designed to simplify and enhance the use of C# expression trees.
It provides a familiar C#-like syntax while offering advanced extensibility, making it a compelling choice for developers
building domain-specific languages (DSLs), rules engines, or dynamic runtime logic systems.

XS.Extensions is a collection of useful extensions for the XS language, including:

- Async/Await
- Enumerable/Yield/Break
- While
- For
- For Each
- Usings
- String Interpolation
- Injection (access to IServiceProvider)
- Configuration (access to IConfiguration)
- Debugging
- Nuget Package Management
