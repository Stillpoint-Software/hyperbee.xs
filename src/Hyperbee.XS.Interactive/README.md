# Hyperbee.XS.Interactive: Notebook tooling for Hyperbee.XS

## Hyperbee.XS.Interactive

This repository contains .NET Interactive Kernel for XS. It allows you to run XS code in a Jupyter notebook or in the .NET Interactive.

### **What is XS?**

[XS](https://github.com/Stillpoint-Software/hyperbee.xs) is a lightweight scripting language designed to simplify and enhance the use of C# expression trees.
It provides a familiar C#-like syntax while offering advanced extensibility, making it a compelling choice for developers
building domain-specific languages (DSLs), rules engines, or dynamic runtime logic systems.
