## Description

Casting is used to convert a value from one type to another. XS supports direct casting, type checking, and safe casting.

## Syntax

```abnf
; Casting Expressions
cast-expression = primary-expression ("is" typename / "as" typename / "as?" typename)

typename = identifier *( "." identifier ) [generic-arguments]
```

## Examples

```xs
var value = 42L;
var cast = value as int;
var isInt = value is int;
var safeCast = value as? int;
```
