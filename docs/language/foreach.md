## Description

The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over a collection and execute a block of code for each item. This construct requires the `Hyperbee.XS.Extensions` package.

## Syntax

```abnf
; Foreach Loop
foreach-loop = "foreach" "(" "var" identifier "in" expression ")" (complex-statement / terminated-statement)
```

## Examples

```xs
var list = [1, 2, 3];
foreach (var item in list) {
    item;
}
```
