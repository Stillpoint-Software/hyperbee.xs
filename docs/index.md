# e***X***pression***S***cript (***XS***) :rocket:

ExpressionScript (**XS**) is a minimalist scripting language designed to align directly with .NET Expression Trees. 
Its purpose is to simplify the creation, evaluation, and manipulation of expressions by offering a scripting syntax 
that mirrors Expression Tree constructs.

### **Key Features**

1. **Alignment with Expression Trees**: XS constructs map to corresponding .NET Expression Tree constructs.
2. **Simplified Syntax**: Write expression trees using a clean scripting language.
3. **Extensibility**: Extend the language with custom parsers for specific domain needs.
