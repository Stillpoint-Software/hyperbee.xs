# e***X***pression***S***cript (***XS***) :rocket:

e***X***pression***S***cript (***XS***) is a minimalist scripting language designed to
simplify c# Expression Trees.

## Summary of Objectives

## Summary of Objectives

1. **Map directly to `System.Linq.Expressions`**:
   - Constructs in XS align conceptually and functionally with `System.Linq.Expressions`.
2. **Simplify Expression Tree Creation**:
   - Avoid manually building expression trees by providing an intuitive scripting interface.
3. **Support All Expression Types**:
   - Fully support constructs like variables, blocks, conditionals, null-coalescing, method calls, loops, and try-catch.
4. **Extensibility**:
   - Allow custom expressions to plug into the language syntax.
5. **Type Safety**:
   - Provide clear type inference and explicit type promotion rules.
6. **Readable and Writable Expressions**:
   - Allow reverse generation of XS code from existing expression trees.
